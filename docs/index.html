<h2>üí∞ City Income Tax Revenue & Estimated School Revenue</h2>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Year</th>
    <th>City Income Tax Revenue (2%)</th>
    <th>School Revenue (0.5%)</th>
    <th>School Revenue if Levy Passes (1.25%)</th>
  </tr>
  <tr><td>2015</td><td>$21.16 million</td><td>$5.29 million</td><td>$13.23 million</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2023</td><td>$24.77 million</td><td>$6.19 million</td><td>$15.48 million</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Because the city tax is based on 2% of total qualifying income, we can estimate school income tax revenue proportionally:</p>
<ul>
  <li>0.5% school tax = 25% of city revenue</li>
  <li>1.25% proposed school tax = 62.5% of city revenue</li>
</ul>

<h2>üë©‚Äçüè´ Teaching Staff & Class Sizes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Contractual class size limit: <strong>30 students per class</strong>. This limit is part of the teachers' union agreement, suggesting it was considered the maximum effective size for learning.</li>
  <li>Actual student-teacher ratio in 2023: <strong>13.6:1</strong>. This is less than half of the contractual maximum, implying that class sizes could be increased‚Äîif needed‚Äîwithout exceeding effective learning standards or union agreements.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means the district is operating at significantly lower class sizes than allowed. Reallocation or reduction of teaching staff could maintain educational effectiveness without additional tax funding.</p>

<h2>üè´ Impact of Private School Enrollment on Public Schools</h2>
<p>Private schools such as St. Aloysius, Bowling Green Christian Academy, Montessori School of BG, and Sleek Academy are educating over 550 students in 2025 alone. This significantly reduces public school enrollment. The result is twofold:</p>
<ul>
  <li>State and federal funding formulas are based on public school enrollment. Lower enrollment reduces the amount of funding a district receives per student.</li>
  <li>The availability of EdChoice and other state-sponsored scholarships redirects funding to private schools, accelerating the resource drain from public education budgets.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="highlight">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is <strong>no justification</strong> for increasing taxes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enrollment has dropped significantly, reducing overall educational demand.</li>
  <li>City tax revenue has risen, indicating available local funding without additional levies.</li>
  <li>Class sizes are already well below contracted limits, suggesting staffing could be optimized before asking for more taxpayer money.</li>
  <li>Private school growth is shifting educational and financial burdens away from public infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="highlight">Vote <strong>NO</strong> on the 0.75% School Tax Levy</h2>
<p>Protect taxpayer dollars. Demand better management before more money.</p>
